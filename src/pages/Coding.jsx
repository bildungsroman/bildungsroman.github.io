        <Intro>
          I'm a dedicated full-stack engineer with a passion for frontend
          development and serverless technologies. Recently, I've been expanding
          my skills in developer advocacy and sharing what I've learned with the
          community{" "}

          and online. I love good documentation and am committed to empowering
          others by creating user experiences that feel natural and intuitive,
          even for beginners.

        <Intro>
          My main stack consists of JavaScript frameworks: React, NextJS, and
          NodeJS. I upgraded to TypeScript in 2021 and haven't looked back at
          plain JS since. I've worked with Python and Golang in the past, but
          have forgotten much of the former and wasn't a huge fan of the latter.

        <Intro>
          I've worked on serverless applications since 2018, primarily using AWS
          services such as Lambda, API/HTTP Gateway, DynamoDB, SQS, SES, and S3.
          I'm very familiar with serverless architecture and have worked on both
          the frontend and backend of serverless applications. If you don't
          believe me, ask Jeremy Daly - I was named a{" "}
